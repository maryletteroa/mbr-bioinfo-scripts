# Notice
A lot of these scripts are still under development or evolving, so please use with caution.

In general, scripts are named `<file_format>_<description>`. `file_format`s are standard data formats used in bioinformatics analysis and to which these scripts are applied. This just makes it easier to look for these scripts when put in `PATH`.

# About
This is a collection of simple scripts used to parse and/or manipulate bioinformatics related datasets. Python scripts were developed, and tested using `python 3.6.x` (unless they're old, so probably `python 2.7.x`)
